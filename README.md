# AKQA Frontend test
 
We will now kindly ask you to do a small test so that we can get a bit deeper into your skills as a frontend developer. We created a simple design of a webpage and added it to Figma. 
 
Here is the link: https://www.figma.com/file/Eu0LK5ielUlhT4LJoXjGm3/derma-demo 
 
 
## The task
 
1. Create a simple one-page website.
 
2. Fork the repo and make a pull request.
 
We will then clone it from Git and review it and then we would like you to explain how you build it and why you chose to do it that way, on our next conversation. Please use any tech of your choice. 
 
The design in Figma consist of sections of content, and it is up to you to be creative and develop what you think that is needed for them. But feel free to add JavaScript functionality in any places that you think it would help.
 
## We will be looking at skills like:
 
•	Tech stack (React, Webpack, Gulp, NodeJS, Netlify...)
 
•	JavaScript (ES5, ES6)
 
•	Html and Accessibility (e.g. can you navigate the site with keyboard only, your choice of html tags, ARIA attributes etc.)
 
•	CSS, Sass
 
•	Responsiveness
 
•	Performance (maybe do a Lighthouse test)
 
**We look forward to see your work and feel free to ask relevant questions regarding the task.**
